Hi! This is Raziur Rahman. I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have a wide range of interests it goes from coding, electronics, music production, digital art to writing and more...! I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering (B.Sc, 2009) from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka.

Currently I am working as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.hifipublic.com" target="_blank">HiFi Public</a> here in Dhaka. Mostly coding in JavaScript (React, Redux & Express).

In this blog/personal site I will be sharing my thoughts, experience and experiments about things that I find interesting or worth sharing!
