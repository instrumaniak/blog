Used FLAC as internal audio file format, which reduces the overall project size a lot. At higher audio rate it becomes difficult use many FX, so used audio freezing to render individual tracks to save CPU uses. </p>\n<h2>Timeline based arrangement</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/flow/flow-arrangements.png\" alt=\"Arrangements\"></p>\n<h2>Mixing</h2>\n<p>Used some free plugings from Variety of sound and tokyo down lab.     </p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/flow/flow-mixer.png\" alt=\"Mixer\"></p>\n<h2>Cover art</h2>\n<p>Cover art was made in gimp.
