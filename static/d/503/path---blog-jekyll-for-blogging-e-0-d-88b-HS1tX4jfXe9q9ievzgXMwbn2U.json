{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>For the last few months I have been moving my blog from Blogger to Github pages and spent quite some time and energy to learn the jekyll static site generator, Liquid templating language , git/github and front-end web development in general to make the transition. Why?</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Here are some of the reason why I chose <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">jekyll</a>/<a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">github pages</a> over blogger/wordpress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making customization to the site just the way I like.</li>\n<li>Keeping all the content/source to myself so that I can work offline.</li>\n<li>Keeping everything under version control so that I can keep track of my changes and do much more.</li>\n<li>Getting used to with the developer oriented workflow!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently I am on Windows and installed ruby and ruby DevKit. After some manual installation of required gems and using jekyll that way for a while, I found that simply installing the <code>github-pages</code> gem basically sets up the working environment properly so that just pushing the sources to github builds the site and deploys it. Currently, I am using the <a href=\"http://lanyon.getpoole.com/\">Lanyon theme</a> and have customized it to my taste! Overall, I am happy with this minimalistic but somewhat hi-tech setup!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Using Jekyll for blogging","blurb":"I started to like static site generators and decided to host my blog on github pages."},"fields":{"date":"14 May, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/jekyll-for-blogging/"}}
