{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Sometimes when you have to keep track of some data and don't mind processing it in a quick and dirty fashion, spreadsheet can be of a great help. So lets review the problem at hand- you have a set of text data and you want to keep adding, refining and querying on that set. So you face the need to use a database. For a smaller set of data of less than or about a hundred record items- using a spreadsheet seems to be more intuitive and fast. It's a great tool for prototyping more advanced solution later.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>The basic process</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the first row as the titles of each column and <em>freeze the first row</em> so when you scroll down these column label shows. It makes data entry and query easier.</li>\n<li>For each column use a single type of data.</li>\n<li>Finally use <em>Auto filter</em> to query your data.</li>\n<li>As your data grows you might also find <em>conditional formating</em> to help you navigate around the data.</li>\n<li>For generating quick stats/dashboard <em>pivot table</em> and <em>charts</em> can be used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Example: An audio plugin data set</h2>\n<p>There are many free VST plugins available online. They are of varying quality and I wanted to test them before directly using them on music production. Over the period of a year, I have downloaded about a hundred of these plugins and they are of different types: some are synthesizers, some are effect processors, some works on midi, some are for audio visualization, etc.</p>\n<p>As I install and test any one of them I put that info on the spreadsheet. Each plugin has entry fields for- name, type, installed, tested, rating and comment. Later it becomes quite easy to filter out these data by just using auto filter. Here is a screenshot of my VST plugin data set on LibreOffice Calc.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/001-spreadsheet-or8.png\" alt=\"Using spreadsheet for small data set\"></p>\n<h2>Where to go from here</h2>\n<p>Sooner or later you might need more flexibility and scalability- in that case you might consider using a relational database. Exporting spreadsheet data to CSV and importing that into a database seems like a good idea.</p>\n<p>For my data set management, I am thinking about using Python programming language and sqlite database.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Using spreadsheet as a simple database"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/spreadsheet-as-db/"}}
