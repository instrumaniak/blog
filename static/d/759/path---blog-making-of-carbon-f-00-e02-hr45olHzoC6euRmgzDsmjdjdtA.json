For this project it happened because this is a midi and synth based production. Unluckily, I just couldn't make ardour 3, qtractor to work with lv2 synths, they just kept crashing. So, I went for the traditional linux music production workflow.</p>\n<p>When I started the project I used ardour 3.5 which had a bug which caused my midi files to get deleted. So, I went with seq24 for midi works but later found ardour 3.4 to be working so used it for rest of the sound processing.</p>\n<p>I used bash script to manage my audio session because it was more easy and unsurprising than the other options: non session manager and lash.</p>\n<p>Here is the shell script that was used to manage audio session:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">#!/bin/bash\n\n# This scripts load the project\n# Project code name: Carbon\n# Raziur Rahman, 2015\n\nexport PROJECT_DIR=/home/razi/music-projects/projects/01-carbon\nexport LV2_PRESETS=/home/razi/music-projects/lv2-instruments/presets\n\n#load a2jmidid\na2jmidid -e -u &#x26;\nsleep 2\n\n#Celesta (seq 4)\n$PROJECT_DIR/scripts/ghostess-patch &#x26;\nsleep 3\n\n#Rhodes (seq 5)\n$PROJECT_DIR/scripts/rhodes-patch &#x26;\nsleep 3\n\n#Piano (seq 1)\njalv.gtk -l $LV2_PRESETS/lxs_lv2/piano http://linuxsampler.org/plugins/linuxsampler &#x26;\nsleep 3\n\n#Organ (seq 3)\naeolus &#x26;\nsleep 3\n\n#Bass (seq 2)\njalv.gtk -l $LV2_PRESETS/amsynth/bass-01b http://code.google.com/p/amsynth/amsynth &#x26;\nsleep 3\n\n#Drums\nhydrogen -s $PROJECT_DIR/hydrogen/hydro-carbon01.h2song &#x26;\nsleep 3\n\n#Midi Sequencer\nseq24 --priority $PROJECT_DIR/seq24/carbon-seq24-06.midi &#x26;\nsleep 3\n\n#Remove all connections\naj-snapshot -x &#x26;\nsleep 2\n\n#DAW\n#ardour2 $PROJECT_DIR/ardour2/carbon/carbon.ardour &#x26;\n#sleep 20\n\n#Restoring connections\naj-snapshot -r $PROJECT_DIR/aj-snap/carbon.snap.05\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Instruments/Synths</h2>\n<p><strong>Piano</strong>:  linuxsampler \"The Maestro Concert Grand\" (lv2 plugin). Used qsampler to load the gig file.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/Qsampler.png\" alt=\"qsampler\"></p>\n<p><strong>Bass</strong>: amsynth (lv2 plugin)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/amsynth.png\" alt=\"amsynth\"></p>\n<p><strong>Drums</strong>: Hydrogen. Uses Black pearl kit from AVLinux. (standalone)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/hydrogen.png\" alt=\"hydrogen\"></p>\n<p><strong>Organ</strong>: aeolus (standalone). I used the pedal section, don't know much about real organ, so just went with it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/aeolus.png\" alt=\"aeolus\"></p>\n<p><strong>Rhodes</strong>: fludsynth (dssi plugin)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/FluidSynth-DSSI.png\" alt=\"fluidsynth\"></p>\n<p><strong>Celesta</strong>: hexter (dssi plugin)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/hexter.png\" alt=\"hexter\"></p>\n<p><strong>Lead synth</strong>: sineshaper (dssi plugin)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/Sineshaper.png\" alt=\"sineshaper\"></p>\n<p>I used mostly the default presets except for amsynth. I made that bass sound myself.</p>\n<h2>Midi prgramming</h2>\n<p>used <em>seq24</em> for all midi sequencing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/seq24-patternlist.png\" alt=\"seq24\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/seq24-pattern.png\" alt=\"seq24\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/seq24-songeditor.png\" alt=\"seq24\"></p>\n<h2>Multitrack recording and sound processing</h2>\n<p>Used <em>ardour 2</em> for live mixing during the time of midi programming sessions. Used mhwavedit for recording raw mixes so that I can hear the progress without loading the complete session. Later I recorded all the tracks in ardour 2.  Then imported the project in ardour 3.4 and did rest of the final sound processing there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/A3-carbon-timeline.png\" alt=\"ardour\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/A3-carbon-Mixer.png\" alt=\"ardour\"></p>\n<p>The final sound processing process was basically mixing the tracks and apply some enhancement effects on the master bus. Mostly used ladspa effects for this project.</p>\n<h2>Cover art</h2>\n<p>The cover art was made entirely in <em>GIMP</em>. Put some GIMP generated flame fractal stuff then applied some texture and labels. That's all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/carbon/coverart-gimp.jpg\" alt=\"gimp\"></p>\n<h2>Final words</h2>\n<p>Using Free linux software to produce music could be a difficult experience because of the learning curve. So it took me long time to finish the work. Turning your idea into music is a lengthy way to go and might cause you to learn programming rather than making music! But it's improving and becoming more user friendly day by day.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Making of the track - Carbon"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2015-06-30-making-of-carbon/"}}
